### 3. Fairness Metrics

**Jain's Fairness Index (1.0 = perfect fairness)**

| Algorithm | Fairness Index | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|

| Fixed-Freq (Ours) | **1.000** | Perfect fairness |
| Round-Robin | 1.000 | Perfect fairness |
| Random | 0.991 | Near-perfect |
| Variable-Freq (Ours) | **0.901** | Good fairness |
| Greedy-Energy | 0.276 | Poor fairness |
| Coverage-Based | 0.163 | Very poor fairness |

**Key Insights:**
- Our Fixed and Unknown algorithms achieve perfect fairness
- Variable-Frequency trades some fairness for efficiency
