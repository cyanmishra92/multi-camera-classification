# Multi-Camera Classification System - Design Improvements

## Executive Summary
Based on analysis of the concept papers, current implementation, and simulation results, this document outlines critical design improvements needed to achieve the project's vision of a sustainable, intelligent multi-camera network.

## Current Performance Gaps

### 1. Accuracy Below Requirements
- **Issue**: All algorithms achieve <80% accuracy (target: 80% minimum)
- **Root Cause**: Poor collective accuracy model, no coordination optimization
- **Impact**: System fails to meet basic performance requirements

### 2. Energy Efficiency vs Accuracy Trade-off
- **Fixed**: Energy efficient but low accuracy (56.6%)
- **Variable**: Poor efficiency (3.4 cameras/classification) with lowest accuracy (49.4%)
- **Unknown**: Good accuracy (70%) but massive violations (492)

### 3. Missing Critical Components
- Federated learning (stub only)
- Game theory integration incomplete
- No visualization dashboard
- No test coverage

## Proposed Design Improvements

### Phase 1: Core Algorithm Enhancements (Priority: High)

#### 1.1 Improve Collective Accuracy Model
```python
# Enhanced accuracy calculation with spatial correlation
def calculate_collective_accuracy(participating_cameras, object_position):
    # Consider camera positions and overlapping fields of view
    # Weight contributions by distance and angle
    # Account for correlation between nearby cameras
```

#### 1.2 Strategic Camera Selection
- Implement full game-theoretic selection in fixed frequency algorithm
- Add position-aware utility calculations
- Consider camera specialization based on location

#### 1.3 Adaptive Threshold Tuning
- Dynamic adjustment of participation thresholds

- Adaptive learning rates based on energy

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: Medium)

#### 3.1 Heterogeneous Camera Support
- Different camera types (high/low resolution)
- Variable energy costs and accuracy
- Specialized roles based on capabilities

#### 3.2 Environmental Adaptation
- Time-of-day effects on solar harvesting
- Weather impact on accuracy
- Seasonal variations in energy availability

#### 3.3 Dynamic Network Topology
- Camera failures and recovery
